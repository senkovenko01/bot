# Hi user

#### I present to your attention the Telegram bot.
####To run it, you need to create your Telegram bot with a tool for communicating with BotFather and get a unique Token, as well as come up with a unique username and insert the received data into the application.properties file. You will also need the WebHook Path, you can get it by downloading the ngrok.io program and launching the shortcut with the "https 5000" parameter.
####The bot also knows how to interact with the Weather API, for this you need to register on the official website and get a unique api key and insert it into the code. Enjoy your use
